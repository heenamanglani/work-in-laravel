## Tech stack assumptions 8.0 if running locally without Docker

- `PHP version`
- `Database` - MySQL installed

## DB migrations and seeding

- Please run DB migrations and seed as it is required to run the application smoothly

## Assuming .env variables are set before starting

- API_KEY = p2lbgWkFrykA4QyUmpHihzmc5BNzIABq
- DB_CONNECTION=mysql
- DB_HOST=mysql
- DB_PORT=3306
- DB_DATABASE=scootinaboot
- DB_USERNAME=sail
- DB_PASSWORD=password


## I recommend to use Docker set up :)
